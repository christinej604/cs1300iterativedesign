        <p>
          As a group of computer science students at Brown University, we wanted
          to iteratively design for a startup that is could be more practical in
          our daily life. We decided to design for a startup called Taro.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <img
            src="taro-mission.png"
            class="d-block w-50 align-items-center"
            alt="taro's mission statement"

      <div class="row" id="sketching">
        <h2 class="text-center">Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
        <p>
          To summarize above, Taro is a website designed to be a premium
          subscription/membership based platform for software engineers who want
          to future their career. The idea is that with a payment, Taro will
          give exclusive access to information about jobs and how to get a job
          ranging from Q&As with leads from top tech companies and creating
          optimized performance reviews. The idea is to focus on the networking
          and non-technical side of the job.
          <br /><br />
          After looking at the concept of the startup, we assumed that our users
          consist of (1) software engineers currently employed, (2)
          undergraduate students looking for internship or post-grad
          opportunities, (3) recruiters at different companies. Software
          engineers who are currently employed would be impacted by this website
          because then they are able to learn tips and tricks about how to do
          their job better. Additionally, if they want to pivot companies, this
          website would provide valuable information for that. Undergraduate
          students would benefit from this because they are jumping into a field
          without much prior experience and would benefit from learning how to
          work as a software engineer and more specifically, how to work as a
          software engineer for a top tech company. Lastly, recruiters would
          benefit from the website because they are able to find software
          engineers who are ambitious and very much either currently on the job
          hunt or looking to further their career by switching companies. Our
          users who would interact with their desktop.

          From the wireframe, we made an interactive high-fidelity wireframe
          using Figma, and in our studio, we received feedback from the
          colleagues. Click

          Here are some critiques that we have received:

          <li>
            Interaction

              <li>Add an interaction screen after clearing history.</li>
              <li>
                Add an interaction that helps users sign out of their account.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Current design is so that the user can click anywhere outside of
                "sign in" button to take you out of sign in box, but change it
                so that the user can click anywhere outside of the sign in box.

              <li>
                Add more clarity to what the salary page is about and its

              </li>
              <li>
                Add more clarity to how the "Events for You" and "Calendar" work
                on the "Networking Events" section.

              <li>
                Create consistency between expert advice and career advice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add a scroll bar to our pages to indicate that there are more
                content.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fill in the white space with filter instead of creating a filter
                button.
              </li>
              <li>
                Change 3 bars on the profile page to a button that expands all.
              </li>
              <li>
                Include date, location, and time in the networking events along
                with a short blurb about the event.
